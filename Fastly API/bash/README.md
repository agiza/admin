# Fastly Example API shell scripts

## Description
These scripts are only for example use and should be used to create your own scripts for managing Fastly. They only use bash / curl and each script will focus on one particular part of the API.

While I have tried to test these scripts as thoroughly as I can there may be bugs, security holes or flat out errors as such....These scripts are provided as-is with no warranty real or implied. Use at your own risk.

## Requirements
- A working POSIX system with curl installed
- A Fastly account and user with superuser privileges.

## Getting started
These scripts all assume the presence in your home directory of a .fastly/api-creds.sh file. The contents of this file should look like:
```
#!/bin/bash

export FASTLY_API_KEY="somekey"
export FASTLY_SERVICE_ID="some_service_id"
```
